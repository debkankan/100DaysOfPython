On Day-20 & Day-21 we are going to create the FAMOUS SNAKE GAME.

Today's goal includes:
    - Creating the Snake
    - Moving the snake
    - Controlling the snake movement using Keyboard

So we built a Snake Class and wrote the business logic over there (snake creation, movement & Controlling with keyboard)

And we created a main.py which creates a snake object and initiates the starting of the game.


Solution Reference: Snake.py,  main.py
