# 🐍 Day 21 – Snake Game (100 Days of Python)

Welcome to Day 21 of my #100DaysOfPython challenge!  
Today’s project is a **classic Snake Game** built using Python’s `turtle` module with a clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

In this game, you control a snake that moves continuously in one of four directions. The goal is to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen. With every piece of food the snake eats, it grows longer and your score increases.  
However, the game ends if:
- The snake hits the wall
- The snake collides with its own body

│
├── main.py # Main game logic and control flow
├── snake.py # Snake class: movement, extension, collision logic
├── food.py # Food class: randomly generates food on screen
├── score_board.py # ScoreBoard class: displays score & GAME OVER
└── README.md # Project documentation

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Class composition**
- **Inheritance**
- **Collision detection**
- **Working with the `turtle` and `time` modules**
- **Keyboard event handling**

## 📌 Features

- Real-time snake movement with keyboard controls:
  - `W` - Up
  - `S` - Down
  - `A` - Left
  - `D` - Right
- Automatically increases in length when food is eaten
- Increments score and updates UI dynamically
- Displays a "GAME OVER" message when the game ends
